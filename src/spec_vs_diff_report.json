      "requirement": "Ensure all Discord links across the site (Contact section, Dashboard Support, Payment panel) use the DISCORD_INVITE_URL constant and that no old Discord URL occurrences remain for navigation.",
      "reason": "While the constant is updated in config and some components import it, the diff summary does not provide enough concrete code evidence for all required UI link locations (ContactSection, Dashboard Support tab, and PaymentPanel) nor proof that no old Discord URLs remain anywhere.",
