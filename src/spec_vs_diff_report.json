  "summary": "Diff implements a premium dark cyberpunk UI refresh with updated logo/banner references, improved typography/contrast, and broader glass/neon styling across sections. One key uncertainty is whether the actual new image assets were added under the required public path (no new files shown). Diff also introduces some UX behaviors (search/filter + localStorage persistence/reset) not explicitly requested.",

      "requirement": "Replace the current site logo and banner with new premium versions and update the UI to use the new asset filenames; all asset references point to files under frontend/public/assets/generated and load correctly (no broken images).",
      "reason": "The code references the new premium asset filenames, but the diff shows no added/changed files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the actual asset replacement cannot be verified from the provided diff summary.",
